title: Assumptions in AI Research
---

I am currently writing my first bigger paper, in the sense that I spent a lot of time on the idea and implementation of the underlying project.
Recently, I have realized that I make a huge amount of assumptions about my project and being a junior researcher multiple of them actually already turned out to be wron, while I still spent a lot of time doing work under these wrong assumptions. I hope this gets better with more experience ;)
Sad evidence against that being only a problem of the young and dumb is the huge number of papers that miss out on a proper baseline. You probably saw this somewhere. For example incarnated as a novel learning algorithm that is missing random search as a baseline or a novel learning task that is missing a random agent as baseline.
Especially when working on very novel methods, it is important to explicitly remember what your assumptions are. It is probably a good idea to take on the extra work now to justify them, instead of later realizing you did a lot of unneeded work.

Taking false assumptions can tank the worth of your whole project.
