Hello 🙋‍♀️
My name is Samuel. I studied at ETH and Cambridge, worked for [DeepL](deepl.com) and now work in Frank Hutters group at Uni Freiburg.
In this blog I write about all things I am generally curious about. 

The purpose of this blog for me is (i) to share what I learned so that you can learn it quicker, (ii) to organize my thoughts 
so that I understand better what I learned and lastly (iii) to connect with like-minded people like you.
