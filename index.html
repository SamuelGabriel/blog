Hello 🙋‍♀️  
My name is Samuel. I studied at ETH and Cambridge, worked for [DeepL](https://deepl.com) and now work in Frank Hutter's group at Uni Freiburg.
In this blog I write about all things I am generally curious about. 

The purpose of this blog is to share leaernings, thoughts and struggles to make friends and help.
