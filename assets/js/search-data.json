            "title": "Goal of Evolution",
            "content": "When you see how evolution works and what things it does going from molecule structures which existence leads to an increase of their existence again to mammals and plants, which have a lot of different things around the actually reproducing molecules. I just can’t stop but wonder what is this process for? I know the classical scientific answer would be: most likely nothing. It also is the case whatever process we humans look at we try to see goals of agents, even when there are none. The case of evolution might not be any different. Even if that is the case an interesting related question would be to ask what is a trend one can see in evolution. . So far one has seen the move to way more ‘complex’ world. This might be true on the level of an individual creature, but if we define complexity as Kolmogorov complexity. The Kolmogorov complexity of a string is the shortest program by which this string could be generated, in some given programming language. We might for this thought experiment assume planet earth as the intepreter of DNA strings. Then under the assumption that DNA is the major factor defining a creature we could say a human for example takes no more than 1.4 GB to describe (which is the uncompressed storage space available in a DNA, but actually a lot of it is unused in reality). Trivially a body could store much more information by for example storing entirely different DNA in each cell, but it does not. Even creatures of the same race, like all the grass a field is full of, share a lot of their code (DNA). . Therefore, I claim evolution slowly decreases complexity (in the Kolmogorov sense) of planet earth. It feels wrong to say that the crown of evolution would be a planet that is completely uniform, s.t. it can be described with a minimum of code, but if one thinks the principles of evolution to the end it might also be only an intermediate level of evolution which sparks all the diversity we see in our world, but in the long run a single recreator (creature or such) builds a monopole on living, because it is the most competetive across the environments of planet earth. . It is not clear from the observations though that evolution really yields a minimally coding world, but the so far decreasing complexity could well just be a by-product of another more powerful process at work. . &lt;!– . Example Markdown Post . Basic setup . Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format: . YEAR-MONTH-DAY-filename.md . Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting .
